This directory contains raw data that is input into the construction of spatial property price indices for Germany created by Ahlfeldt, Heblich, Seidel (2022).

It contains the following files and folders

IMMO_PURCH_USING.dta		Processed pruchase price transactions data, generated by codes in the DATAGENERATION subfolder. Raw data has to be accessed from FDZ
IMMO_RENT_USING.dta		Processed rental price transactions data. Raw data has to be accessed from FDZ

DATAGENERATION 			Folder that contains raw data and do files for processing

To use the Ahlfeldt-Heblich-Seidel algorithm - avaiable in a separate publicly accessible code and data directory - to generate spatial price indices, 
one of the IMMO_*_USING data set needs to be renamed to "transactions.dta" and copied to the DATA/INPUT folder in the public directory.
